              <h3>Java</h3>
              <p>
                By using Java in Eclipse, I was able to create a rock, paper, scissors game where the user goes against the AI during the game. The user can choose what they want to throw out and how many rounds they want to have. The game will display who will win at the end for each round and who wins as a whole. The game is in the link below.

              <h3>Unity</h3>
              <p>
                While on Unity in my class, we have to do a lot of assignments, and finally, I had to work with other people for a final project based on everything we learned on Unity. The theme of this project was surviving waves of enemies. On this game, I worked on creating scenes with buttons to go to the menu (did not create the sprite option or sprites in general), how to play description, and to the game itself. Also, I worked on the lose screen when the user dies from the enemies and created a timer for how long the user last in the waves on enemies. The user can reset or go back to menu after the game is over too by clicking on the buttons that appear when the user dies in the game. To add on to this, I added an enemy spawner to make sure that enemies keep on spawning after they are destroyed by the user. Finally, I added collision on when the user hits the enemies and when the enemies hit the user. The music (actually sounds) the user hears while playing the game is actually from me too!

              I always loved my computer science classes every since I was in high school. In addition to that, I loved playing video games a lot. As a result, I decided that I want to create or be involved in a video game company in order to understand how it feels to create video games. I thought that it may be fun too.
